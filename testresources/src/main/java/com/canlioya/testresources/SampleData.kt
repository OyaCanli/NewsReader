    "New message warns that results are changing quickly and may not yet include reliable sources",
    "<p>Google has started warning users when they search for a topic that is likely to have poor results, as part of its effort to tackle “data voids” on the search engine.</p> <p>The new warning was spotted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/noUpside/status/1407724577120165890\">Renee DiResta</a>, an academic who studies misinformation at Stanford University. “It looks like these results are changing quickly,” Google will now caution users. “If this topic is new, it can sometimes take time for results to be added by reliable sources.”</p> <p>“First time I’ve seen this response from Google Search,” DiResta said. “Positive step to communicating that something is newsy/breaking (my search was for a breaking culture war story), and highlighting that facts are not all known or consensus on what happened is still being formed.”</p> <p>While social media is regularly linked with misinformation, researchers have long cautioned that search engines can be powerful tools for spreading falsehoods. <a href=\"https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/\">Data voids</a>, search engine queries that have little to no results, can often lead to fringe claims being given undue prominence – a particular concern for breaking news.</p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/new-notice-search-rapidly-evolving-results/\">In a blogpost</a>, Danny Sullivan, public liaison for search at Google, said: “We’ve trained our systems to detect when a topic is rapidly evolving and a range of sources hasn’t yet weighed in. We’ll now show a notice indicating that it may be best to check back later when more information from a wider range of sources might be available.”</p> <p>The warning tends to appear for searches with a lot of recent hits, but few from reputable sites. For instance, a recent report of a UFO sighting in Wales had spread rapidly among conspiracy theorists, but had little mainstream attention. That meant that a search for the terms “ufo 106 mph” briefly brought up the warning, Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/24/22549157/google-unreliable-search-results-changing-quickly-misinformation-conspiracy-theories\">told the tech site Recode</a>.</p> <p>“Someone had gotten this police report video released out in Wales, and it’s had a little bit of press coverage. But there’s still not a lot about it,” Sullivan said. “But people are probably searching for it, they may be going around on social media – so we can tell it’s starting to trend. And we can also tell that there’s not a lot of necessarily great stuff that’s out there. And we also think that maybe new stuff will come along.”</p>",

    "Committee says firms have been left guessing with UK government’s ‘short-term approach’",
    "<p>The government’s failure to set out an industrial policy agenda has left UK businesses unclear about the future at a time when a green economic recovery is urgent, according to MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee.</p> <p>The group of cross-party MPs has accused the government of taking a “short-termist, unclear and unwelcome” approach to the UK’s industrial policy since scrapping the business department’s industrial strategy in March.</p> <p>In a highly critical report the committee warned that the decision to abandon the strategy, put forward by Theresa May’s government in 2017, had led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/28/industrial-strategy-uk-build-back-better-covid-government\">a “fragmented” Treasury-led plan</a> which would risk “widening the gap” between government and business.</p> <p>Darren Jones, the chair of the committee, warned that the “short-termist” approach adopted by the prime minister and the chancellor came at a time when business leaders were “crying out for long-term consistency and clarity” as the UK began to rebuild a low-carbon, post-pandemic economy outside the EU.</p> <p>The government scrapped plans to overhaul its industrial strategy in favour of a Treasury-led “plan for growth” to help revive the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>“The reality is that it is nothing more than a list of existing policy commitments, many of which are hopelessly delayed,” Jones said. “Long term cross-economy challenges – from problems in productivity and our ageing workforce to the opportunities presented by new technologies and the net zero transition – no longer appear to command ministerial support as long-term, cross-party, whole-of-government policy priorities.”</p> <p>The committee added that the government’s decision to disband its in-house think-tank, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/mar/23/why-the-uk-government-really-abolished-its-own-industrial-strategy-council\">Industrial Strategy Council</a>, led by the Bank of England’s Andy Haldane, would remove the “expert, independent oversight” which had offered “important guidance” on how to shape the UK’s industrial policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones said business leaders and parliamentarians were “now left guessing what the government’s approach is to industrial policy, with no expert oversight reporting on what ministers have actually been able to deliver”.</p> <p>In response a government spokesperson said that since the industrial strategy was published more than four years ago the government had legislated to end the UK’s contribution to climate crisis by becoming a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, and was continuing to fight the Covid-19 pandemic while forging a new path outside the EU.</p> <p>“That’s why it was right to change our approach too, with our new plan for growth setting out the opportunities we’ll seize across the UK to drive economic growth, create jobs and support British industry as we level up and build back better out of this pandemic,” the spokesperson said.</p>",

The assumption is that even if the under-12s are greenlighted to get their shots over summer, the Department of Education will shrink from insisting children are vaccinated before entering school buildings. This doesn’t make a lot of sense; a child can’t attend state school in New York without a health form attesting to his having had all the other vaccinations. The assumption is, however, that there will be sufficient pushback from parents worried about the shallowness of the trials on young children to make mandating Covid vaccinations too disruptive. On this basis – enragingly – masks are still likely to be required in the classroom, too. There aren’t a lot of consolations for this – but looking beyond summer to autumn and the nights drawing in, at least we’ll still have something to bitch about.</p> <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/28/vaccination-back-to-school-ritual-new-york\">Emma Brockes – Will vaccination become part of the back-to-school ritual?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/28/vaccination-back-to-school-ritual-new-york\">Will vaccination become part of the back-to-school ritual? | Emma Brockes</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60d976238f083905e9de5c19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-28T07:12:45.263Z\">8.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Nayanika Guha reports for us on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/28/india-covid-gender-gap-women-left-behind-in-vaccination-drive\">the gender gap in India’s vaccine roll-out</a>:</em></p> <p>Deep-rooted structural inequalities and patriarchal values are to blame for India’s worrying Covid vaccine gender gap, campaigners and academics have warned.</p> <p>As of 25 June, of the 309m Covid vaccine doses delivered since January 2021, 143m were administered to women compared with nearly 167m to men, according to <a href=\"https://dashboard.cowin.gov.in/\">CoWin</a>, India’s national statistics site – a ratio of 856 doses given to<strong> </strong>women for every 1,000 given to men.
